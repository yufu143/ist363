        <h1>Yujia Fu</h1>
        <p>One <span style="color: #E38E49;">personal</span> thing about me is I've been trying to get more into gaming; I'm currently playing Disco Elysium and Deltarune. For <span style="color: #E38E49;">professional</span> things, I am an IM&T major with a concentration in Web Design and Management. Something <span style="color: #E38E49;">peculiar</span> about me is I apparently used to be very extroverted but then, very suddenly and randomly, just wasn't anymore.</p>
